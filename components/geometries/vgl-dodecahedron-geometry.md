A component for generating a dodecahedron geometries, corresponding [THREE.DodecahedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/DodecahedronGeometry). Properties of [VglGeometry](vgl-geometry) are also available as mixin. 



## props 
- `radius` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 1` 
Radius of the dodecahedron. 

- `detail` ***number*** (*optional*) 
Setting this to a value greater than 0 adds vertices making it no longer a dodecahedron.
