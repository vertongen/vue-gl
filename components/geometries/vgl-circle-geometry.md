This is a simple shape component of Euclidean geometry, corresponding [THREE.CircleGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/CircleGeometry). It is contructed from a number of triangular segments that are oriented around a central point and extend as far out as a given radius. It is built counter-clockwise from a start angle and a given central angle. It can also be used to create regular polygons, where the number of segments determines the number of sides. Properties of [VglGeometry](vgl-geometry) are also available as mixin. 



## props 
- `radius` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 1` 
Radius of the circle. 

- `segments` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 8` 
Number of segments (triangles). 

- `theta-start` ***number*** (*optional*) 
Start angle for first segment. 

- `theta-length` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: [object Object]` 
The central angle of the circular sector.
